# splunk-api-log-extractor
Vanilla Python (no external dependencies) script to retrieve log from a Splunk server using the web interface API

(AKA 'https://localhost:8000/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/...' instead of 'https://localhost:8089/services/...').


Usefull when the regular API is not reachable.
